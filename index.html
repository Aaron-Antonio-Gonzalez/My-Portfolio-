      <p>My name is Aaron Gonzalez, and I grew up in Laredo, Tx. I was a lead singer with a band my friends and I started at when I was 18, our biggest accompleshment was playing at the Never Say Never Music Festival in 2011 and 2012. I moved to San Antonio when I was 26 to pursue school. I have worked at Central Market as a Barista for the past 3 years. I have had a huge interest in coding since I was little growing up around my dad's Computer Tech friends. I am now currently enrolled in UTSA's Coding Bootcamp to hopefully become a Full-Stack Web Developer one day.</p>
      <p>
      Now almost three months into the UTSA Bootcamp. I have learned to proficiently use HTML and CSS. I still struggle with Javascript but with time I am sure I can get over some of the struggles of learning the logic. I am really enjoying the front-end of developing.
